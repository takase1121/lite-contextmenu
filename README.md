### Installation
- for lite users, just download and place `init.lua` into your `plugins` directory as `contextmenu.lua`
- for `lite-xl` users, download `init.xl.lua` instead

### TreeView integration
- you will need to install [lite-fsutils](https://github.com/takase1121/lite-fsutils) for it to work.
- replace `treeview.lua` with the one in the repo
